Hi there! I am a sixth-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Florida, where I work in the INIT Lab under the of Dr. Lisa Anthonyâ€˜s supervision. I work at the intersection of **Human-Centered Computing** and **Machine Learning**. In particular, I am passionate about developing Human-Centered AI technologies to support health behavior change.

I am currently working on designing and developing an LLM-based chatbot to support health coaches in behavioral weight management programs.
